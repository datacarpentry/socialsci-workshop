Data Carpentry’s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools
for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less
pain. This workshop teaches data management and analysis for social science
research including best practices for data organization in spreadsheets,
reproducible data cleaning with OpenRefine, and data analysis and visualization
in R. This curriculum is designed to be taught over two full days of instruction.

Materials for teaching data analysis and visualization in Python
and extraction of information from relational databases using SQL are in development. 

> ## Getting Started
>
> This curriculum assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the
> workshop. Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate
> actively.

> ## Data
> 
> This curriculum uses the same dataset throughout. 
> 
> **Studying African Farmer-led Irrigation (SAFI) dataset**
> 
> The [SAFI Project](http://www.safi-research.org/) is a research project
> looking at farming and irrigation methods used by farmers in Tanzania and
> Mozambique. This dataset is composed of survey data relating to households and
> agriculture in Tanzania and Mozambique. The survey form was created using the
> ODK (Open Data Kit) software via an Excel spreadsheet. This is used to create
> a form which can be downloaded and displayed (and completed) on an Android
> smartphone. The results are then sent back to a central server. The server can
> be used to produce the collected data in both JSON and CSV formats. We will
> use a sample of the collected data in CSV format throughout this workshop. The
> data can be [downloaded from
> Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/SAFI_Survey_Results/6262019).

This curriculum is currently available using R as the main programming language. Materials for teaching it with Python are in development.
