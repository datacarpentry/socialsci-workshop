Data Carpentryâ€™s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working
with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop
teaches data management and analysis for social science research including best practices for data organization 
in spreadsheets, reproducible data cleaning with OpenRefine, data analysis and visualization in either R or Python
and extraction of information from relational databases using SQL. This workshop is designed to 
be taught over two full days of instruction.

> ## Getting Started
>
> This lesson assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. 
> Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. 
> 
> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup/) tab to 
> get access to the required software and data for this workshop.

> ## Data
> 
> This workshop uses data from two different sources.
> 
> Audit of Political Engagement 11, 2013 (UKDS: SN7577)
> 
> Where to find it:
> The dataset is an open dataset available for download from the [UK Data Service](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/ ). It can > > be found by searching using the keyword SN7577.
> 
> There are several variations of the dataset available. We will be using the 2013 edition. Several other years are available, > although the columns may change. There is also a combined dataset for the years 2003-2012 under SN 7404. As with most datasets > in the UK Data Service the data can be downloaded in a variety of formats.  Rather than downloading directly from the UK Data > Service site, copies of the data in csv (comma separated values) and .sqlite (for the SQL lesson)  has been made and can be > > downloaded from the [setup](./setup.md) page.
