Data Carpentryâ€™s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working
with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop
teaches data management and analysis for social science research including best practices for data organization 
in spreadsheets, reproducible data cleaning with OpenRefine, data analysis and visualization in either R or Python
and extraction of information from relational databases using SQL. This workshop is designed to 
be taught over two full days of instruction.
