Data Carpentryâ€™s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working
with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop
teaches data management and analysis for social science research including best practices for data organization 
in spreadsheets, reproducible data cleaning with OpenRefine, and data analysis and visualization in R. This workshop is designed to 
be taught over two full days of instruction.

Materials for teaching data analysis and visualization in Python
and extraction of information from relational databases using SQL are in development. 

> ## Getting Started
>
> This lesson assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. 
> Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively.

> ## Data
> 
> This workshop uses the same dataset throughout. 
> 
> **Studying African Farmer-led Irrigation (SAFI) dataset**
> 
> The [SAFI Project](http://www.safi-research.org/) is a research project looking at farming and irrigation methods used by farmers in Tanzania and Mozambique. 
> This dataset is composed of survey data relating to households and agriculture in Tanzania and Mozambique. 
> The survey form was created using the ODK (Open Data Kit) software via an Excel spreadsheet. 
> This is used to create a form which can be downloaded and displayed (and completed) on an Android smartphone. 
> The results are then sent back to a central server. 
> The server can be used to produce the collected data in both JSON and CSV formats.
> We will use a sample of the collected data in CSV format throughout this workshop. 
> The data can be downloaded from FIXME.
