All of the social science lessons use the same data set throughout. 
The data is tabular (rows and columns), similar in structure to what
you might have in a spreadsheet.

SAFI (Studying African Farmer-Led Irrigation) is a currently running
project which is looking at farming and irrigation methods. This is 
survey data relating to households and agriculture in Tanzania and 
Mozambique. The survey data was collected through interviews 
conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 using forms downloaded
to Android Smartphones. The survey forms were created using the ODK 
(Open Data Kit) software via an Excel spreadsheet. The collected data 
is then sent back to a central server. The server can be used to 
download the collected data in both JSON and CSV formats. This is a 
teaching version of the collected data that we will be using. It is not the full dataset.

The survey covered such things as; household features (e.g. 
construction materials used, number of household members), 
agricultrual practices (e.g. water usage), assets (e.g. number and 
types of livestock) and details about the household members.

The basic teaching dataset used in these lessons is a JSON 
formatted dataset which is used directly in the Python lesson.  For
the other lessons a subset of the JSON dataset is used and has been 
converted into CSV format. 

The individual fields and the survey questions asked to produce the 
data in the CSV formatted version are given below. We will only 
reference a subset of the fields in the lessons.
